1)
Randomly generate two list to use for a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

2)
Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

3)
Say you are given a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write a function that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

4)
Write a Python program to read first n lines of a file.
Write a Python program to read last n lines of a file.
Write a Python program to read last n lines of a file.
